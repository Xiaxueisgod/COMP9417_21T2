how to run code?
first, run Data_preprocessing.py, then will generate X_train.npy, X_test.npy,Y_train.npy,Y_test.npy files
second, run part_of_preprocessing.py,then will generate X_train2.npy, X_test2.npy,Y_train2.npy,Y_test2.npy files
finally, can run different models code. 

The model code is divided into initial model(X.py) and optimization model(X_opt.py)

use models:
1.Decision Tree, 
2.Gradient Boost Decision Tree, 
3.K-Nearest Neighbour, 
4.Logistics Regression, 
5.Naive Bayes, 
6.Neural Network, 
7.Random Forests, 
8.XGBoost


used module:
jupyter notebook
sklearn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib


when run code, need put the two input files in the same directory with code file.
